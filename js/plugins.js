В летописях говорится, что в этот год Ида, правитель Берниции и король англов, перенёс столицу королевства на место нынешнего Бамборо. С течением времени англы поработили соседние кельтские племена и подчинили себе королевства Катраэт и Регед (современная Камбрия). Расцвет Берниции пришёлся на 603 год, когда Этельфрит, внук Иды, присоединил к своим владениям королевство Дейра и таким образом стал королём объединённого королевства Нортумбрия, границы которого простирались почти на треть острова.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nЭтельфрит подарил укрепление в Бамборо своей жене Беббе, назвав крепость в её честь Беббанбург.\\\\\\\"\\\",\\\"Sketch\\\":\\\"enciclopedia/bebbo\\\"}\",\"{\\\"Name\\\":\\\"Асгард\\\",\\\"Category Symbol\\\":\\\"book\\\",\\\"Description\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"Эта страна, которую Один, Вилли и Ве сделали для себя, после чего Один населил ее своими сыновьями (Асами), редкими жителями других миров (Нйорд, Фрейр и Фрейя из Ванов, Локи - из Великанов), а также душами воинов, которые умерли с мечем в руках. Последние проживают в Валгалле и ждут последней битвы. Асы - это боги, посылающие на Землю защиту для людей от великанов, также они следят за жизнью человечества.Одно из главных отличий религии викингов от других - существование отрицательных качеств у богов. Они уже не считаются непогрешимыми, как, например, бог у христиан, не являются абсолютно хорошими, как у китайцев, и несут (хотя и в будущем) ответственность за свои злодеяния, в отличие от греческих олимпийцев.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nАсы и воюют, и убивают, и нарушают клятвы, но в целом они, конечно, необходимы человечеству, без Асов люди не смогли бы сопротивляться Великанам. Вообще Асы удивительно похожи на людей - они также смертны (если бы не волшебные яблоки, обитатели Асгарда уже давно бы сошли в небытие), также могут быть покалечены, они далеко не всемогущи, и так далее. Поэтому Скандинавские Саги здесь тоже выгодно отличаются от остальных мифологий - боги приближенны к людям, так же могут любить и страдать, поэтому и ведут они себя по-человечески, в отличие от тех же Олимпийцев.\\\\\\\"\\\",\\\"Sketch\\\":\\\"enciclopedia/asgard\\\"}\",\"{\\\"Name\\\":\\\"Англосаксонский период\\\",\\\"Category Symbol\\\":\\\"book\\\",\\\"Description\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"Англосаксонский период — эпоха в истории Англии, начавшаяся с высадки на Британских островах в V веке отрядов англов, саксов и ютов и образования англосаксонских государств и завершившаяся нормандским завоеванием страны в XI веке.\\\\\\\\nА началась она после того, как в начале V века римские легионы покинули Британию, и бритты горько об этом пожалели.\\\\\\\\nИх число сильно уменьшилось за долгие годы войн, охранять Адрианов вал было некому, и толпы скоттов и пиктов свободно проникали через его проломы. Они убивали жителей, грабили богатейшие города, и такими частыми были их кровавые и опустошительные набеги, что бедные бритты жили в постоянном ужасе.\\\\\\\\nОни отправили послание в Рим с мольбой о помощи. Его назвали о \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Горестное стенание бриттов\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". И говорилось в нем: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Чужеземцы теснят нас к морю, а море опять бросает нас к чужеземцам, и нам не миновать смерти: в резне ли, в пучине ли\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Но римляне в это время сами оборонялись от неприятеля сильного и жестокого.\\\\\\\\nИ вот жители Британии, будучи не в силах более выдерживать набеги своих северных соседей пиктов и скоттов,  в 449 году, согласно преданию,  призвали на помощь ютов под началом Хенгиста и Хорсы.\\\\\\\\nТе разбили пиктов и скоттов, и их успехи привлекли в страну новые толпы англов, саксов и ютов. Так началась более чем столетняя борьба между бриттами и иноземными пришельцами. В итоге бритты, несмотря на упорное сопротивление, были порабощены, и часть из них  принуждена была искать убежища в горах Уэльса и Корнуолла, где они ещё долго сохраняли свою независимость, а другие переселились на соседний полуостров Франции – Арморику  (нынешняя Бретань). Кельтское сказание признает героем этой национальной борьбы короля Артура, создателя образцового рыцарского общества, известного под именем рыцарей Круглого стола.\\\\\\\\nЦивилизованная Британия - важная часть Римской империи - превратилась в варварскую Англию.\\\\\\\"\\\",\\\"Sketch\\\":\\\"enciclopedia/sax\\\"}\"]","Encyclopedia Scene Options":"","Unknown Entry":"? ? ? ? ?","Unknown Entry Display":"Это еще не было обнаружено.","Total Window Text":"Всего","Total Window Rounding":"2","Number Entries":"true","Display Window Options":"","Scroll Wait":"300","Scroll Speed":"1","Scroll Deceleration":"0.92","Auto Scroll":"true","Large Icon Multiplier":"3.3","Text Options":"","Yes Text":"Да","No Text":"Нет","Price Text":"Цена","No Price Text":"Не продаётся.","Key Item Text":"Ключевой предмет.","Possession Text":"В инвентаре","Equip Type Text":"Тип экипировки","Armor Type Text":"Тип брони","No Armor Type Text":"Нет","Weapon Type Text":"Тип оружия","No Weapon Type Text":"Нет","Skill Type Text":"Тип Навыка","No Skill Type Text":"Основные","Drops Text":"Лут","Show Drop Chances":"true","Drop Chance Text":"Шанс","Sketch Text":"Эскиз","Note Text":"Примечание","Success Rate Text":"Показатель Успеха","Consumable Text":"Расходный материал","Effects Text":"Эффект предмета","HP Effect Text":"Востановление HP","MP Effect Text":"Востановление МР","TP Effect Text":"Востановление ТР","Add State Text":"Причины","Remove State Text":"Лечение","Add Buff Text":"Баф","Add Debuff Text":"Дебаф","Remove Buff Text":"Обновить Баф","Remove Debuff Text":"Очистить Дебаф","Grow Text":"Поезда","Learn Spell Text":"Учит","Party Ability Text":"Специальный Эффект","Half Encounter Text":"Сокращение случайных встреч","No Encounter Text":"Никаких Встреч","Cancel Surprise Text":"Отменить Сюрприз","Raise Preemptive Text":"Повышения Преимущественное","Gold Double Text":"2x Выпадение Золота","Drop Item Double Text":"2x Выпадение Предметов","Description Text":"Описание","Element Text":"Элемент","Attack Speed Text":"Эффект Скорости","Attack Times Text":"Дополнительные Атаки","Attack State Text":"Применяется","MP Cost Text":"Стоимость МР","TP Cost Text":"Стоимость ТР","User TP Gain Text":"\"Пользователь\" получает ТП","Battle Removal Text":"Пропадёт после боя","Walking Removal Text":"Удалится после прогулки","Damage Removal Text":"Удаляется после повреждения","Duration Text":"Продолжительность","Infinite Text":"Бесконечность","Turns Text":"Получается","Seal Skill Types Text":"Закрыт","Add Skill Types Text":"Открыт","Seal Skill Text":"Закрыт","Add Skill Text":"Гранты","State Resist Text":"Сопротивляется"}},
